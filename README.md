Institution: St. Clair College, Windsor (Canada)

Overview
This repository contains a research paper examining how Artificial Intelligence (AI) can strengthen Access to Justice (A2J) within the Canadian legal system. The paper explores how AI-driven tools—such as automated document assembly, legal information systems, triage platforms, and decision‑support technologies—can modernize justice processes, reduce systemic delays, and support self‑represented litigants.

Purpose of the Paper
The research aims to provide an evidence‑based analysis of how AI can:

Reduce financial and procedural barriers to justice

Improve efficiency in courts, tribunals, and administrative bodies

Enhance legal literacy and public access to information

Support vulnerable populations, including newcomers, rural communities, and individuals with disabilities

Inform policy reform through predictive analytics

Strengthen fairness, transparency, and ethical governance in AI adoption

Key Themes
Legal Information Tools  
AI systems that provide plain‑language explanations, multilingual support, and guided legal processes.

Automated Document Assembly  
Tools that help users prepare affidavits, small‑claims forms, immigration applications, and other standardized documents.

AI‑Driven Triage and Issue‑Spotting  
Systems that classify legal problems, assess urgency, and direct users to appropriate courts or services.

Decision Support for Judges and Tribunals  
AI applications that summarize case files, identify precedents, and improve case‑flow management while preserving human judgment.

Court Administration and Case Management  
AI tools that streamline scheduling, notifications, e‑discovery, and evidence organization.

Ethical and Legal Considerations  
Emphasis on transparency, non‑discrimination, privacy protection, and human oversight.
